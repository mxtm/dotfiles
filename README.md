# dotfiles

An assortment of dotfiles that I use

They can be "installed" by package they are applied to with GNU Stow, as so:

```bash
stow scripts termite tmux vim
```

Running install-all.sh script automatically installs all the available dotfiles, by executing the above so this is equivalent:

```bash
./install-all.sh
```
